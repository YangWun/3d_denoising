### What is this repository for? ###

* A NEW denoising method that combines 3D Non-Local Means and LBP-TOP (local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes)
* Code version: 0.01-alpha
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### Dependencies ###

* Python 2.7
* OpenCV (for Python)
* NumPy
